# Full Stack Node App

Basically Since my new job is using Node.js and I like Vue.js. I'm going to follow along Travesty Media Full Stack tutorials. 

Key things I want to do differently is just to follow his advice about post his tutorials on github. I will attemp to do the follow things I don't see him do all the time...

## Dockerize the app

## Add and Use Sass

## Use Commitizen

## Try to integrate TypeScript into the Client if not Angular app.
